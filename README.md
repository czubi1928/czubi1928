# üëã Hi, I'm Patryk Czubinski

### üöÄ Data Fanatic | PostgreSQL Database Administrator | SQL Programmer

I'm a database professional passionate about building robust, scalable data systems. My background in database
administration and SQL development provides a strong foundation for my transition into the world of **Data Engineering
**.

üí¨ **Languages:** English / Polski

## üë®‚Äçüíª About Me

As a passionate **SQL Programmer** and **PostgreSQL Database Administrator** based in Warsaw, Poland, I have been
dedicated to optimizing and securing data operations since 2022. My career began as a Junior Data Programmer, where I
honed my skills in database management and performance optimization. I now specialize in ensuring the reliability and
performance of PostgreSQL databases through thorough optimization and robust security.

Currently, I‚Äôm expanding my skills toward **Data Engineering**, aiming to bridge the gap between **database management**
and **data pipelines**.

**Key Achievements:**

- Implemented a NoSQL Apache Cassandra database, **increasing system throughput by 428%** compared to the previous
  solution (from 6,014 [PostgreSQL] to over 31,748 [Apache Cassandra] records per second).
- Automated the generation of database performance and security reports using pgBadger, leading to faster issue
  identification and resolution.
- Modified the AUTOVACUUM policy in PostgreSQL, resulting in a **10% increase in data writing speed**.
- Developed a Python program for archive processing that **reduced data restoration time from hours of manual work to
  near-instantaneous**.

**Core Competencies:**

* **Database Management:** PostgreSQL Admin, NoSQL (Cassandra), Performance Tuning, Security, Data Modeling
* **Data Programming & Automation:** Advanced SQL, Python (Pandas), Bash Scripting, ETL/ELT Logic
* **Infrastructure & Operations:** Monitoring (Prometheus, Grafana), Performance Testing, Configuration Management
* **Data Engineering Concepts:** Data Pipelines, System Architecture, Data Archiving & Restoration

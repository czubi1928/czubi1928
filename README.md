# üëã Hi, I'm Patryk Czubinski

## üë®‚Äçüíª About Me

As a passionate **SQL Programmer** and **PostgreSQL Database Administrator** based in Warsaw, Poland. I have been
dedicated to optimising and securing data operations since 2022. My career began as a Junior Data Programmer, where I
honed my skills in database management and performance optimization. I now specialise in ensuring the reliability and
performance of PostgreSQL databases through thorough optimization and robust security.

Currently, I‚Äôm expanding my skills toward **Data Engineering**, aiming to bridge the gap between **database management**
and **data pipelines**.

**Key achievements:**

- Implemented a NoSQL Apache Cassandra database, increasing system throughput by 428% compared to the previous
  solution (from 6014 [PostgreSQL] records per second to over 31748 [Apache Cassandra]). This process included
  installation, configuration, database structure creation, and performance testing, as well as installing a monitoring
  tool for continuous performance optimisation;
- Automated the generation of reports based on database logs using the pgBadger tool, enhancing database performance and
  security;
- Modified the AUTOVACUUM policy, resulting in a 10% increase in data writing speed;
- Created using Python an archive processing program that restores data almost instantly upon customer request compared
  to manual, hourly work;

**My expertise spans a wide range of skills, including:**

SQL Programming, PostgreSQL Administration, NoSQL Databases (Apache Cassandra), Database Performance Optimisation,
Database Security, Data Management, Report Automation, AUTOVACUUM Policy Configuration, Monitoring Tool Implementation,
Data Archiving and Restoration, Software Development, Data Analysis, Project Management, Performance Testing,
Configuration Management, Database Structure Design, System Throughput Improvement, Log Analysis, Innovative Solutions,
Data Science Trends, Effective Data Management Practices

## üèóÔ∏è Featured Projects

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ [üéµ Million Song - Data Engineering Project](https://github.com/czubi1928/million_song_project)

An **end-to-end data engineering project** built around the *Million Song Dataset*. It demonstrates a **modern data
stack** for building scalable, testable, and automated data pipelines ‚Äî from raw ingestion to analytics and
visualization.

**Key features:**

* Ingestion and transformation of large `.h5` music datasets into Parquet format
* Automated workflows with Apache Airflow (ETL orchestration)
* Data modeling and quality tests using dbt (star schema design)
* Storage and querying through DuckDB + MinIO (lakehouse architecture)
* Interactive dashboards and data exploration via Apache Superset
* Fully containerized setup with Docker Compose for local deployment

**Tech Stack:**

`Python` ‚Ä¢ `Apache Airflow` ‚Ä¢ `dbt` ‚Ä¢ `DuckDB` ‚Ä¢ `PostgreSQL` ‚Ä¢ `MinIO (S3)` ‚Ä¢ `Apache Superset` ‚Ä¢ `Docker` ‚Ä¢ `Pandas` ‚Ä¢
`h5py`

**üí° Highlights:**

This project showcases my ability to design and implement a **complete data platform** ‚Äî covering data ingestion,
transformation, modeling, orchestration, and visualization ‚Äî with a strong focus on **reliability, scalability, and
clean architecture**.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ [üìã Job Offers & Market Analysis](https://github.com/czubi1928/analyzing_job_offers)

A data engineering / analytics project that **processes, analyzes and visualizes IT job advertisements** to uncover
trends in skills demand, salary ranges, role distributions, and more. It‚Äôs designed to show your ability to take raw
unstructured data (job ads) and turn it into insights that inform decision-making.

**Key features:**

* Web scraping or ingestion of job listings (e.g. parsing HTML / JSON from job portals)
* Aggregation & analytics (e.g. trends over time, skill frequency, salary distributions)
* Dashboards or visualizations to interpret the results (charts, tables, filters)

**Tech Stack:**

`Python` ‚Ä¢ `BeautifulSoup` / `Requests` (or similar web scraping libs) ‚Ä¢ `Pandas` / `NumPy` ‚Ä¢ `SQL` / `SQLite` (or other
database) ‚Ä¢ `Matplotlib` / `Seaborn` (visualization) ‚Ä¢ `Jupyter` / notebooks ‚Ä¢ (Optional) `Docker` for reproducible
environment

**üí° Highlights:**

This project showcases how you can extract actionable insights from unstructured data, combining web scraping, data
modeling, and visualization. It reflects strengths in data engineering, analytics, and applied text processing.

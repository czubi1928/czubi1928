# 👋 Hi, I'm Patrick Czubinski

## 👨‍💻 Database Administrator | SQL Developer | Aspiring Data Engineer

I'm a data-focused engineer who builds reliable, scalable data systems. I started my career as a junior data programmer
and evolved into a PostgreSQL Database Administrator and SQL Developer. Today I'm transitioning to Data Engineering —
designing data pipelines, orchestration, and end-to-end data platforms while keeping reliability and performance first.

📍 **Location:** Warsaw, Poland
💬 **Languages:** English / Polski

## 🏗️ Featured Projects

### 1️⃣ [final touch...] [🪙 Bitcoin Monitor - Data Engineering Project](https://github.com/czubi1928/bitcoin_monitor)

A Bitcoin price **monitoring tool** that **ingests** price data from the CoinCap API, **processes** and **models** it,
and exposes **interactive dashboards** for trend analysis and alerting. The project demonstrates building a
**production-ready data pipeline** with **infrastructure-as-code**, **orchestration** and **cloud data warehousing**.

**Tech Stack**: `Python 3` • `Pandas` • `Apache Airflow` • `dbt` • `Snowflake` • `Terraform` • `Docker` • `CoinCap API`

**💡 Highlights:** ingestion and processing of Bitcoin prices, Airflow DAGs for orchestration, dbt models for
transformations and testing, Terraform-managed infra and Snowflake as the analytics warehouse; designed for
extensibility (alerting, CI/CD, dashboarding).

### 2️⃣ [🎵 Million Song - Data Engineering Project](https://github.com/czubi1928/million_song_project)

An **end-to-end data engineering project** built around the *Million Song Dataset*. It demonstrates a **modern data
stack** for building scalable, testable, and automated data pipelines—from raw ingestion to analytics and visualization.

**Tech Stack:** `Python` • `Apache Airflow` • `dbt` • `DuckDB` • `PostgreSQL` • `MinIO (S3)` • `Apache Superset` •
`Docker`

**💡 Highlights:** Showcases my ability to design and implement a **complete data platform**, covering ingestion,
transformation, modeling, orchestration, and visualization with a focus on reliability and clean architecture.

### 3️⃣ [📋 IT Job Market Analysis](https://github.com/czubi1928/analyzing_job_offers)

A data analytics project that **scrapes, processes, and visualizes IT job advertisements** to uncover trends in skills
demand, salary ranges, and role distributions. It demonstrates turning raw, unstructured web data into actionable
insights.

**Tech Stack:** `Python` • `BeautifulSoup` • `Pandas` • `NumPy` • `SQL (SQLite)` • `Matplotlib` • `Seaborn` • `Jupyter`

**💡 Highlights:** This project combines web scraping, data modeling, and visualization to extract value from
unstructured data, reflecting skills in data engineering, analytics, and text processing.
